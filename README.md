## What is Hobbes?

Hobbes is a multi-functional Twitter bot that can remind users of tweets, countdown the amount of days left in the year, and posts Tweets about upcoming Lakers games.

## Countdown feature

The countdown feature just simply has a running countdown of the days left in the year, and will restart on the New Year (EST).


## Tweet reminder feature (still-in-progress)

The tweet reminder feature will allow a user to request to be reminded about a tweet on a date or time by them following a specific format to mention the bot with.

For example if a user wants to be reminded about a tweet on a specific date, the following format has to be used when mentioning the bot: "Reminder MM-DD-YYYY".

If a user wants to be reminded about a tweet at a specific time, the following syntax has to be used: "Reminder 30 seconds", "Reminder 50 minutes", "Reminder 1 hour", etc. The currently supported timeframes are seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years. The time requested has to be completely typed out, not shortened as "hr, sec, or min".

## “Lakers are playing” posts (still-in-progress)
Hobbes will make tweets based on when the @Lakers Twitter account posts that the Lakers are playing.
